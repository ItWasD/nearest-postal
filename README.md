Please if anything read the very bottom of this so you will not have issues using this resource.

This is based off of the original nearest-postal script as it still functions the same I just made it use less client files and added an in game player customizable UI menu with savable setting to player licenses. 

If you are a developer and are making a new postal map use the Original https://github.com/DevBlocky/nearest-postal as I have removed the main files to make a new postal map that he has implemented into his script. 

This is an updated UI integration of https://github.com/DevBlocky/nearest-postal I used his original code and reworked it into this.

This will work with all other postal maps just change the new-postals.json to your file you are using.

/Postal [postal_code]

Do /postal [postal_number] to set a gps route to the postal specified do /postal again with active route to clear it.

/postalmenu to bring up the UI customization menu.

I will not be providing support as this is a simple drag and drop (only tested on QBox fuck everything else) 

I've made 3 showcase videos of my testing and updates it works for me just fine.

I recommend using FPS at the lowest value or completely removing it and using the CHECK_INTERVAL = 1500 in the code for best performance across all clients but, do as you please.

RENAME FILE TO nearest-postal AND MAKE SURE 0xludb-fivem IS INSTALLED AND IS STARTED IN YOUR SERVER.CFG BEFORE nearest-postal.
