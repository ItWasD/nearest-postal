ðŸš¨Please if anything read the very bottom of this so you will not have issues using this resource.ðŸš¨

Basic info / Credits:

This is based off of the Original [nearest-postal](https://github.com/DevBlocky/nearest-postal) script by DevBlocky as it still functions the same I just made it use less client files and added an in game player customizable UI menu with savable setting to player licenses. 

If you are a developer and are making a new postal map use the Original [nearest-postal](https://github.com/DevBlocky/nearest-postal) as I have removed the main files to make a new postal map that he has implemented into his script. 

This will work with all other postal maps just change the new-postals.json to your file you are using.

Commands:

/Postal [postal_code]

/postal [postalnumber] to set a gps route to the postal specified do /postal [dontputanything] again with already active route to clear it.

/postalmenu to bring up the UI customization menu.

It's not working:
Yes, yes it is working, I will not be providing support as this is a simple drag and drop, if you can not figure it out that isn't my problem and you need to take some time and read.
I've made 3 showcase videos posted in the QBox Discord of my testing and updates it works for me just fine.

Recommendation:

I recommend using FPS at the lowest value or completely removing it and using the CHECK_INTERVAL = 1500 in the code for best performance across all clients but, do as you please.

ðŸš¨RENAME FILE TO nearest-postal AND MAKE SURE 0xludb-fivem IS INSTALLED AND IS STARTED IN YOUR SERVER.CFG BEFORE nearest-postal. (only tested on QBox fuck everything else)ðŸš¨


*updating to hide on inventory open, add option to show only in vehicle, add option to only show postal and hide FT and Meters.*
