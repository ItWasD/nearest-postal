This is based off of the original near-postal script as it still functions the same I just made it use less client files. 

If you are a developer and are making a new postal map use the Original https://github.com/DevBlocky/nearest-postal as I have removed the main files to do so. 

This is an updated UI integration of https://github.com/DevBlocky/nearest-postal

/Postal [postal_code]

Do /postal when you have a set gps / postal to clear it

/postalmenu to bring up the UI 

I will not be providing support as this is a simple drag and drop (only tested on QBox fuck everything else) 

I've made 3 showcase videos of my testing and updates it works for me just fine.

I recommend using FPS at the lowest value or completely removing it and using the CHECK_INTERVAL = 1500 in the code for best performance across all clients but, do as you please.
